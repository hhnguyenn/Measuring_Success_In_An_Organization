## Scenario <br/>
You are a former Navy officer and fighter pilot, and you are now the controller of a division of TransGlobal Airlines, a large organization that operates a fleet of corporate jets for charter at several airports in the southeast part of the United States. Your division’s private charter clients include several Fortune 500 companies in the region. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) has informed you that the company is considering the acquisition of two smaller aviation firms in the region specializing in chartered flights for luxury vacations using light aircraft (60 passengers or less). The CFO has tasked you with assessing the organizational benefits of acquiring these aviation firms. The CFO intends to develop a new business plan for the organization if your analysis recommends moving forward with the acquisition. <br/>

After an initial assessment, the company has shortlisted two airlines, Company A and Company B, to examine further for acquisition. To understand all aspects of the two airlines under consideration, you have visited each proposed site to assess their performance. The assessment included creating a balanced scorecard for each airline with all four components, financial, internal processes, customers/market, and learning and growth, that will impact the acquisition of each firm. <br/>

The CFO has asked you to generate two scenarios for the proposed acquisition based on your analysis and governing or predictive assumptions. They include a worst-case scenario that considers the most serious outcomes that could occur if anticipated targets and assumptions are dramatically wrong; and a best-case scenario if anticipated targets and assumptions significantly exceed forecasts. <br/>

Based on your assessment and analysis of the companies, deliver a PowerPoint Presentation for senior management’s review and analysis. You will also write an executive summary with your recommendations for the leadership team.
